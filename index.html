<h2> 27 Dates by 27</h2>
<img src = "">

<p> Hi! My name is Darya! I have a goal of going on 27 dates before my 27th birthday on January 27th! If you are on this website, it means we matched somewhere & I would love to go on a date with you :) Take my quiz below & book it! My best friend made this website so if you have feedback or would like to purchase your own, please let me know on the date. She will also be looking for a job in June, so if you work for a tech company in Los Angeles and like her work - keep that in mind.</p>
